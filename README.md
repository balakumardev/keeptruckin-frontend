# Keeptruckin - Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6. 

Demo of this application can be found here: http://keeptruckin.balakumar.xyz
(Recommend to visit this demo site before going through the code)

## Running the Application
I have added the appropriate Docker configs to run and serve the application. All you need are two steps
1. Run the `ng build` command to build the angular project into `/dist` folder
2. Then run `docker-compose up -d` to run the application
